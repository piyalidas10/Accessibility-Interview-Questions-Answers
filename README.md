| 1   | What is WAI-ARIA? <br/><br/> WAI-ARIA is a technology that can be used to add extra information about the structure and function of a page. This can be especially helpful for users with disabilities who are using assistive technologies.
| 2   | What is the WCAG? <br/><br/> The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of standards for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. The WCAG is developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international standards body. There are three levels in WCAG 2.1, Level A (the lowest level), Level AA, and Level AAA (the highest level). These are usually pronounced as ‘single A’, ‘double A’, and ‘triple A’. Most organisations set their standards at level AA because it is both achievable and meaningful, without being too disruptive to the design and development process of a website. 
| 3   | Level A guidelines that should get followed by organizations: <br/><br/> 1) Alt text for images is compulsory.<br/> 2) For pre-recorded audio-only or video-only media, provide a descriptive transcript to make it understandable.<br/> 3) Headings should be nested appropriately.<br/> 4) ARIA labels should be there at specific places to make them recognizable.<br/> 5) Don’t use div and span; rather, use real elements like links and buttons.<br/> 6) Content should be in a meaningful way.<br/> 7)Content shouldn’t be based only on shape, size, color, sound, or other sensory characteristics.<br/> 8) If using color for words, background, or links, provide its information in the text.<br/> 9) Avoid including audio or video in content that plays automatically.<br/> 10) Make sure the user can navigate the content using only keyboard as well.<br/> 11) There should be pause, stop, hide for moving elements like, videos and animations.<br/> 12) Never use such an element that blink more than three times in 1 second.<br/> 13) Don’t give irrelevant links.Give descriptive labels in form fields or use ARIA-described by to include help text in forms.
| 4   | Level AA guidelines that should get followed by organizations:<br/><br/> 1) Captions are needed for live audio and video. Also, videos should include narration for better reach.Device orientation should not be the problem for content. 2) It should be available in both horizontal and vertical forms on all devices. 3) The color contrast of text is 4.5:1, for text and image 3:1, and the text size should be a minimum of 16px. 4) Content on hover or focus should appear adequately and should not overlap other content.The website should contain any of these - a table of contents, sitemap, or a list of related pages. 5) Headings and labels of each page should be unique. 6) Keyboard focus should be highly visible, and visible elements should have focused all the time if using the keyboard. 7) The same component on a web page should appear in a consistent order.To convey a status message, use ARIA live regions or ARIA alert to make it understandable for screen readers. 8) Web forms should have accurate labels and navigation.
| 5   | How do I know if my website is compliant with WCAG standards? <br/><br/> Your website should adhere to the four principles of WCAG in order to be considered compliant. The four principles are outlined in the acronym “POUR” which stands for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. You can also use an accessibility checker like UserWay’s Accessibility Scanner to determine your WCAG conformance. More recently, many countries (or states and provinces) across the globe have adopted WCAG as the basis for their accessibility standards and regulations – including regulations such as the <strong>EU Web Accessibility Directive</strong>, <strong>the AODA in Canada</strong>, and of course, <strong>Section 508 Compliance</strong> in the United States.
| 6   | What is the difference between alt text and longdesc? <br/><br/> Alt text and longdesc are two ways of adding descriptions to images on the web. <br/> 1) Alt text is a brief description that is displayed in place of an image if the image cannot be loaded. alt text is primarily used to describe the visual content. <br/> 2) Longdesc is a longer description that can be accessed by clicking on a link or icon. longdesc can be used to provide information about the function of an image.
| 7   | What is the difference between a screen reader and a text-to-speech program? <br/><br/> A screen-reader is a software program that assists blind or visually-impaired users by reading aloud the text that is displayed on the computer screen. A text-to-speech program, on the other hand, is a software application that converts written text into spoken words. <br/> Both screen-readers and text-to-speech programs can be used to improve accessibility for individuals with vision impairments, but they differ in terms of functionality and features. <br/> Screen-readers are specifically designed to work with computer applications and websites, while text-to-speech programs can be used to convert any written text into speech. Screen-readers also typically offer a wider range of features than text-to-speech programs, such as the ability to navigate websites and control the cursor without using a mouse.
