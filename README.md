| 1   | What is WAI-ARIA? <br/><br/> WAI-ARIA is a technology that can be used to add extra information about the structure and function of a page. This can be especially helpful for users with disabilities who are using assistive technologies.
| 2   | What is the WCAG? <br/><br/> The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of standards for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. The WCAG is developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international standards body. There are three levels in WCAG 2.1, Level A (the lowest level), Level AA, and Level AAA (the highest level). These are usually pronounced as ‘single A’, ‘double A’, and ‘triple A’. Most organisations set their standards at level AA because it is both achievable and meaningful, without being too disruptive to the design and development process of a website.

Also, videos should include narration for better reach.Device orientation should not be the problem for content. 2) It should be available in both horizontal and vertical forms on all devices. 3) The color contrast of text is 4.5:1, for text and image 3:1, and the text size should be a minimum of 16px. 4) Content on hover or focus should appear adequately and should not overlap other content.The website should contain any of these - a table of contents, sitemap, or a list of related pages. 5) Headings and labels of each page should be unique. 6) Keyboard focus should be highly visible, and visible elements should have focused all the time if using the keyboard. 7) The same component on a web page should appear in a consistent order.To convey a status message, use ARIA live regions or ARIA alert to make it understandable for screen readers. 8) Web forms should have accurate labels and navigation.
